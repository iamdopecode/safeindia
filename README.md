# **Safe India**

## **Introduction**
**As** a society we have failed. The horrifying incidence of sexual assault and rapes are increasing day by day. I do not want to write an essay on my social media and forget about it once the matter is cooled down. Rather than waiting for another innocent life to suffer. let's find a solution  we have created a monster as a society and we need to fix it as a society. Let's make it happen.  We are creating this open source project to help in whatever way we can. I urge you all to help us out in whatever way possible. Now moving towards the solution.

## **Aim**
**To** create an app that will have a similar UI to Ola/Uber for women safety. It will emphasize mainly on having an "emergency friend" in every area. Women do not need to feel unsafe or scared and to be assured that someone is always there to have their back where ever they go. They can share their location on the go and they can ask for "Emergency Friend" when required even at the slightest level of distress App functionality:-  People can volunteer as "Emergency Friend" and the end user can ask for an "Emergency Friend" in case if they are stranded at any isolated area or feeling unsafe/distressed. People near by who have volunteered will be notified when a user sends out the request. User's location will be shared with the volunteer.  All people on the app can monitor and the closest to her can reach out for help.   One of the biggest challenge is with "Accepting Volunteers" as we do not know if the volunteer has any false intentions.  As of now what i have though of is that the signing up process will include a psycho matrices tool that would help to analyse the mental state of the volunteer. Also following this we can have a facial reaction recognition module where a series of situation and videos will be played and the response recorded from it will help us analyse if the volunteer is showing empathy and help us understand few emotional traits.  This way we can sign up the volunteers. let's make it.  
**Only as a society we can fight this.**
